The Monitair softare provides a one stop solution for an MQTT connected Air Quality node. It is designed to run on the WEMOS D1 Mini. 

It's a work in progreess, but then so is life.

It auto selects Air Quality sensors (SDS011, ZPH01 or PMS5003) and can be used for secure or open MQTT connections. Configuration is via the serial port or over a web connection. 

Look in the documents folder for build and configuration instructions.

Keep watching this repository for regular updates which will include power control of the sensor and over the air (OTA) firmware updates.
